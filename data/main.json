I came back to visit the lovely lady I've worked for almost a year and asked if she was happy with the person tacking care of her house and after saying yes she pause and said \"Paula, non c'Ã¨ nessuna come te!\". This was the first compliment I had ever received for how I did my work and I strived to keep that in mind with every job I strated doing. A deep understanding of who I am and what God is shapping each day is what ultimatly motivates me to do my work well and love people arround me."
